  - Pro tier: $5-10/month per user
  - Team tier: $15-25/month per user

- **Revenue Projections**:
  - Year 1 (2,000 paid users at $8/month average): $192,000
  - Year 2 (5,000 paid users at $10/month average): $600,000

- **Break-even Analysis**:
  - Initial development: $29,000-67,700

- **Integration Testing**: Ensure reliable operation with various AI assistants
- **Documentation**: Invest in clear user guides and examples
- **Community Building**: Allocate resources for user engagement and feedback

### Scaling Considerations

The IPSA extension is designed to operate client-side within VS Code, which significantly simplifies scaling concerns. However, there are still important considerations:

1. **Performance Optimization**: As plan documents grow in size and complexity, performance optimization will be crucial
2. **Memory Management**: Careful attention to memory usage to prevent impacting VS Code performance
3. **Extension Size**: Keep the extension package size reasonable for quick installation
4. **Compatibility Testing**: Ensure compatibility across different operating systems and VS Code versions

By focusing on these scaling considerations during development, IPSA can provide a smooth experience even as user numbers grow and problem complexity increases.
