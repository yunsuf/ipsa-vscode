# IPSA Project Scoping Document

## 1. Project Title
**Iterative Problem-Solving Assistant (IPSA) for VS Code**

## 2. Executive Summary
The Iterative Problem-Solving Assistant (IPSA) is a VS Code extension designed to enhance the capabilities of existing AI coding assistants by providing a structured framework for complex problem-solving. IPSA addresses the limitations of current AI assistants, such as context loss and poor memory management, by establishing a persistent knowledge base and guiding users through an iterative problem-solving process. By acting as a meta-layer around existing AI agents, IPSA improves the quality of AI-assisted solutions while creating valuable documentation as a by-product of the development process.

## 3. Problem Statement/Need
Current AI coding assistants (like those in Cursor, Augment, GitHub Copilot, or general LLMs) struggle with complex, multi-step problems due to:
- Context loss during lengthy problem-solving sessions
- Lack of structured analysis before proposing solutions
- Poor memory management across iterations
- Limited planning capabilities
- Inefficient knowledge accumulation
- Heavy manual re-prompting burden on users

These limitations result in suboptimal solutions, wasted developer time, fragmented documentation, and inconsistent results. Developers need a tool that can enhance their existing AI assistants by providing structure, persistence, and guidance throughout the problem-solving process.

## 4. Project Objectives
- Improve the ability of users to solve complex coding or analytical problems using AI agents within VS Code
- Reduce agent "hallucinations" or context loss by providing a structured, evolving context
- Automate parts of the iterative prompting and knowledge synthesis process
- Enable the creation of a "living document" that tracks the problem-solving journey, plan, and key insights
- Allow for user intervention and control throughout the process
- Facilitate the integration of agent-generated code and documentation into the user's project

## 5. Project Scope

### In Scope
- VS Code extension development using TypeScript
- Session management (start new, resume existing)
- Plan and knowledge base management via Markdown files
- Iterative prompting engine with contextual prompt construction
- Findings extraction and processing
- Output management (documentation and code integration)
- Iteration control and validation
- Basic version control integration
- User interface components within VS Code

### Out of Scope
- Direct LLM API integration (IPSA leverages existing AI agents)
- Standalone application outside of VS Code
- Support for IDEs other than VS Code
- Automated code execution or deployment
- Training or fine-tuning of AI models
- Complex natural language processing within IPSA itself
- Fully automated agent interaction without user oversight
- Enterprise-level team collaboration features (initial focus is on individual developers)

These items are out of scope primarily due to the focus on creating a lightweight meta-layer that works with existing tools rather than replacing them, and to maintain a manageable scope for the initial release.

## 6. Key Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **Extensibility:** Modular design for future enhancements
- **Security:** No direct handling of API keys or sensitive data

## 7. Success Metrics

### Business Impact Metrics
- Reduction in time spent on complex problem-solving tasks by 20-30%
- Increase in successful resolution of complex coding problems by 15-25%
- Reduction in context-related errors or misunderstandings by 30-40%

### Technical Performance Metrics
- Extension load time under 2 seconds
- File operations completed within 1 second
- Prompt construction time under 500ms
- No significant impact on VS Code performance

### User Experience (UX) Metrics
- User satisfaction rating of 4.2/5 or higher
- Adoption rate among target users of 15% within 6 months
- Retention rate of 70% after 3 months of use
- Reduction in manual context management effort by 50%

## 8. Intended Use(s)
IPSA is designed to be used by software developers working on complex coding or analytical problems within VS Code. Specific intended uses include:

- Debugging complex issues that require systematic investigation
- Designing and implementing new features with multiple components
- Refactoring or optimizing existing code that requires careful analysis
- Learning new frameworks or technologies with guided exploration
- Creating comprehensive documentation alongside development
- Solving algorithmic or architectural challenges that benefit from structured thinking

IPSA is intended to complement, not replace, the developer's own problem-solving skills and the capabilities of existing AI assistants.

## 9. Known Risks and Limitations

### Technical Risks
- Limited API access to interact with third-party AI agents
- Potential performance impact with very large plan files
- Dependency on specific VS Code APIs that may change
- Compatibility issues with different AI assistant extensions

### User Experience Risks
- Learning curve for the structured approach
- Potential perception of added complexity
- Risk of over-reliance on the structured process

### AI-Specific Risks
- Cannot prevent underlying AI agent hallucinations
- Limited by the capabilities of the integrated AI assistant
- May not handle highly specialized domain knowledge well

## 10. Potential Mitigation Strategies
- Implement a phased approach starting with manual agent interaction
- Provide clear documentation and tutorials for new users
- Design flexible workflows that can adapt to different problem types
- Include validation steps to verify AI-generated solutions
- Create fallback mechanisms for when agent interaction fails
- Implement robust error handling and user feedback
- Conduct regular user testing to refine the experience
