# Define Problem/Need

## Current State Analysis

AI coding assistants have become essential tools for modern software development, offering capabilities like code completion, explanation, and generation. However, when faced with complex, multi-step problems, these assistants exhibit several critical limitations:

### Key Limitations of Current AI Coding Assistants

1. **Context Loss**
   - AI assistants struggle to maintain awareness of the broader context as conversations progress
   - Information shared in earlier parts of a conversation is often forgotten or deprioritized
   - The assistant's understanding becomes fragmented during lengthy problem-solving sessions

2. **Lack of Structured Analysis**
   - Most AI assistants don't conduct thorough upfront analysis before proposing solutions
   - They tend to jump directly to implementation without proper problem decomposition
   - This leads to piecemeal approaches that miss important considerations

3. **Poor Memory Management**
   - Findings and insights from previous iterations aren't systematically incorporated into reasoning
   - Valuable information is often lost between conversation segments
   - The assistant fails to build upon its own discoveries

4. **Limited Planning Capabilities**
   - AI assistants rarely maintain or evolve a clear plan throughout the problem-solving process
   - They struggle to break complex problems into manageable steps
   - Plans, when created, aren't systematically updated based on new findings

5. **Inefficient Knowledge Accumulation**
   - Valuable insights and code snippets generated during the process are difficult to organize
   - There's no structured way to capture and reference this information
   - Knowledge remains siloed within conversation threads

6. **Manual Re-prompting Burden**
   - Users must manually re-prompt and feed context to the AI repeatedly
   - This process is time-consuming, error-prone, and frustrating
   - It shifts cognitive load from problem-solving to "AI management"

## Impact on Development Workflow

These limitations significantly impact developer productivity and solution quality:

1. **Suboptimal Solutions**
   - The AI may miss important considerations or fail to integrate all relevant information
   - Solutions often address symptoms rather than root causes
   - Edge cases and potential issues are frequently overlooked

2. **Wasted Time**
   - Developers spend excessive time managing the AI's context rather than focusing on the actual problem
   - Repeated explanations and clarifications consume valuable development hours
   - Progress is slowed by the need to constantly reorient the AI

3. **Fragmented Documentation**
   - The problem-solving journey and its insights aren't captured in a structured, reusable format
   - Valuable reasoning and decision points are lost
   - Future troubleshooting or enhancement becomes more difficult

4. **Inconsistent Results**
   - The quality of AI assistance varies greatly depending on how well the user manages to maintain context
   - Similar problems may receive dramatically different solutions
   - Results depend heavily on the user's skill at prompt engineering

## The Need for a Structured Approach

Developers need a tool that can:

1. Provide a structured framework for AI-assisted problem-solving
2. Maintain persistent context throughout the problem-solving process
3. Systematically capture and organize knowledge generated during development
4. Guide both the user and the AI through a methodical approach to complex problems
5. Reduce the cognitive load of managing AI context
6. Create valuable documentation as a by-product of the development process

This need is particularly acute for complex tasks such as:
- Debugging intricate issues
- Designing multi-component features
- Refactoring legacy code
- Learning new frameworks or technologies
- Solving algorithmic challenges

By addressing these needs, we can transform AI assistants from useful but limited tools into powerful partners for tackling complex software development challenges.
