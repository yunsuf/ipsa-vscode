description: Guidelines for continuously improving Cursor rules based on emerging code patterns and best practices.
globs: **/*

- **Rule Improvement Triggers:**
  - New code patterns not covered by existing rules
  - Repeated similar implementations across files
  - Common error patterns that could be prevented
  - New libraries or tools being used consistently
  - Emerging best practices in the codebase
  - **Workflow issues discovered during development**

- **Analysis Process:**
  - Compare new code with existing rules
  - Identify patterns that should be standardized
  - Look for references to external documentation
  - Check for consistent error handling patterns
  - Monitor test patterns and coverage
  - **Document command-line tool behaviors that differ from expectations**

- **Rule Updates:**
  - **Add New Rules When:**
    - A new technology/pattern is used in 3+ files
    - Common bugs could be prevented by a rule
    - Code reviews repeatedly mention the same feedback
    - New security or performance patterns emerge
    - **Tool usage patterns need to be adjusted to avoid errors**
      - Example: [@taskmaster.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/@taskmaster.mdc) for Task Master subtask handling

  - **Modify Existing Rules When:**
    - Better examples exist in the codebase
    - Additional edge cases are discovered
    - Related rules have been updated
    - Implementation details have changed

- **Example Pattern Recognition:**
  ```typescript
  // If you see repeated patterns like:
  const data = await prisma.user.findMany({
    select: { id: true, email: true },
    where: { status: 'ACTIVE' }
  });

  // Consider adding to [prisma.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/prisma.mdc):
  // - Standard select fields
  // - Common where conditions
  // - Performance optimization patterns
  ```

  ```json
  // If you see tool usage issues like:
  "subtasks": [
    {
      "id": 1.1,  // This numeric format causes issues with Task Master
      "title": "Initialize Flutter Project"
    }
  ]

  // Document in [@taskmaster.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/@taskmaster.mdc):
  // - Correct format for IDs
  // - Known limitations and workarounds
  ```

- **Rule Quality Checks:**
  - Rules should be actionable and specific
  - Examples should come from actual code
  - References should be up to date
  - Patterns should be consistently enforced
  - **Tool usage guidelines should include both correct and incorrect examples**

- **Continuous Improvement:**
  - Monitor code review comments
  - Track common development questions
  - Update rules after major refactors
  - Add links to relevant documentation
  - Cross-reference related rules
  - **Document challenges encountered with development tools and their solutions**

- **Rule Deprecation:**
  - Mark outdated patterns as deprecated
  - Remove rules that no longer apply
  - Update references to deprecated rules
  - Document migration paths for old patterns

- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Keep examples synchronized with code
  - Update references to external docs
  - Maintain links between related rules
  - Document breaking changes
