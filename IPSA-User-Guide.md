   cd /path/to/automate_gpt
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the extension:
   ```bash
   # For production build
   npm run compile
   
   # For development build (with better debugging)
   npm run compile:dev
   ```

4. Watch for changes during development:
   ```bash
   npm run watch
   ```

## Installing the Extension

### Method 1: Running in Development Mode

The easiest way to test the extension is to launch it in development mode:

1. Open the project in VS Code
2. Press F5 (or select "Run" â†’ "Start Debugging")
3. This will open a new VS Code window with the extension loaded
4. You'll see "Extension Development Host" in the title bar of the new window

### Method 2: Installing the VSIX Package

To install the extension for regular use:

1. Package the extension into a VSIX file:
   ```bash
   # Install vsce if you don't have it
   npm install -g @vscode/vsce
   
   # Package the extension
   vsce package
   ```

2. Install the extension in VS Code:
   - Open VS Code
   - Go to Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X)
   - Click the "..." menu at the top of the Extensions view
   - Select "Install from VSIX..."
   - Navigate to and select the `ipsa-0.1.0.vsix` file

## Uninstalling the Extension

### Method 1: Uninstalling from VS Code

2. Find "IPSA" in your installed extensions
3. Click the gear icon and select "Uninstall"
4. Reload VS Code when prompted

### Method 2: Removing Development Version

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Showing Up

If the extension commands don't appear in the Command Palette:
- Make sure the extension is properly installed or running in development mode
- Check the "Output" panel (View â†’ Output) and select "IPSA" from the dropdown to see any error messages

### Plan Documents Not Saving

If you're having issues with plan documents:
- Make sure you have a workspace open (the extension requires a workspace)
- Check that you have write permissions to the workspace directory

### Session Not Resuming

If your session doesn't resume correctly:
- The session data is stored in VS Code's global state
- Try ending the current session and starting a new one

### Build Warnings

If you see webpack warnings during build:

```
WARNING in configuration
The 'mode' option has not been set, webpack will fallback to 'production' for this value.
```

This has been fixed by setting the mode explicitly in webpack.config.js. If you still see this warning:

1. Make sure webpack.config.js has the mode set:
   ```javascript
   const config = {
     target: 'node',
     mode: 'production', // This line should be present
     // ...
   };
   ```

2. Or use the npm scripts that specify the mode:
   ```bash
   npm run compile:dev   # Development mode
   npm run package       # Production mode
   ```

## Development Notes

### Project Structure

- `src/extension.ts`: Main extension code
- `src/document/`: Document management system
- `src/models/`: Data models and interfaces
- `src/test/suite/`: Test files

### Running Tests

```bash
npm run test
```

### Linting Code

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Current Implementation Status

The current implementation includes:
- âœ… Basic extension activation
- âœ… Document management system
- âœ… Session management
- âœ… Status bar integration
- âœ… Configuration settings
- ðŸ”„ State management system (in progress)

### Next Steps

The next task to implement is the State Management System, which will provide a more robust way to manage the extension's state.
